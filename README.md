## Background

Since the 20th century, the number and the proportion of the elderly population in China has increased rapidly. From 2000 to 2018, the number of people aged 60 and above increased from 126 million to 249 million. Over the same period, the proportion of the elderly rose from 10.2% to 17.9%, more than twice the world average. Aging is one of the most severe social problems in China in the future. 

A large number of the elderly are suffering from various physical and mental health problems. The number of people that have chronic diseases in China is around 300 million, among which the burden of chronic diseases among people over 65 years old accounts for 50%. Chronic diseases respectively account for 85.3% and 79.5% of the total deaths in urban and rural areas. In this context, finding groups that face different health problems can help better design the healthcare system and deliver health aids to the targeted groups. This project aims to explore what factors may influence the elderly's mental health in China and give some policy insights based on the findings.

## Data Source

This project used the survey data from [CHARLS](http://charls.pku.edu.cn/users/sign_in/en.html)(China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Survey) in 2015 and 2018. All of the data could be download from the official website. Anyone who is interested in the topics of aging and health could request the access of the data from the website organizer. The request may need about one day to be approved. CHARLS data are all released for public, but sometimes the website is inaccessible for some reasons. If you are interested in the topic but cannot download the data, please contact me (*xw256@georgetown.edu*).

CHARLS is a nationwide survey that began to conduct baseline interviews and data collection in 2011 and the subjects were middle-aged and elderly people what were over 45 years old. This dataset covered individual, household and community information including health status and functioning, healthcare and insurance, retirement and pension, personal assets, household assets, household income and history, and so on. After selecting heath related variables and excluding observations with some missing values, I obtained a sample dataset of 16117 subjects in 2015 and 17180 subjects in 2018.

## Visualization Tool
All of the visualizations in this project is made by **Tableau** and are available at **_Tableau Public_**. You can download **_Tableau Public_** from this [link](https://public.tableau.com/) for free.

## Rural vs. Urban

This visualization is interactive with year. Every point represents the average mental health index and functioning index of a community (each community is randomly selected based on the survey design). We can select the subset data of 2015 or 2018. The disparity between the rural and the urban in mental health for the elderly people are similar.

## East vs. West
